            <value>Nathan Cohen commented in his "Monday Miscellany" column in the Toronto Daily Star that local police feared that recently closed        after-hours clubs had reopened as "hangouts
              for male and female homosexuals." On January 21, James
                Egan's letter of rebuttal, "Police Concern for Homosexual Clubs
              'Illogical,' " was published in the Star. Egan was
              Canada's foremost gay activist during the period 1949-64. (See also August

            <value>Maclean's published a two-part series by Sidney Katz entitled "The Homosexual Next Door: A
              Sober Appraisal of a New Social Phenomenon." These are believed to be the first
              full-scale articles in a mainstream Canadian publication to take a generally
              positive view of homosexuality. Katz was influenced in his views through contact
              with James Egan, Canada's most prominent gay
              activist for the period 1949-64. The articles
              were later reprinted in a pamphlet of the same name by Pan-Graphic Press of San
              Francisco in its Mattachine Review Reprint Series.

              gossip, jokes and cartoons, and personal ads. It was renamed Gay International with issue twelve (January 1965), and moved to 980 Queen Street E. It

              useless and that articles and books written by practising homosexuals that try

            <value>Member of Parliament Arnold Peters (NDP-Temiskaming) was preparing to
              introduce a private Members bill calling for the modification of the Canadian
              Criminal Code to decriminalize homosexual acts between consenting adults in
              private. The bill never reached the floor of the House of Commons. Peters may
              have been influenced by the lobbying efforts of Garrfield
                D. Nichol (pseud, of Gary
                  Nichols) of the Committee on Social Hygiene, Stittsville,
              Ontario. The Committee on Social Hygiene, pretty much a one-person operation,
              had been formed in 1963 to investigate the extent of
              homosexuality in eastern Canada and to quietly lobby for reforms to the Canadian
              Criminal Code. (See also May 26,1965.)

              encouraged by Bruce Somers, a Vancouver interior decorator, who became ASK'S first

              parties (Gab 'N' Java), social events and outings, a lending library, and,
              eventually, a drop-in and community centre. The ASK Newsletter was filled with serious articles (some reprinted
              from other sources), news of local events, and Association news, ASK collapsed
              in the summer of 1965 but revived the next year; it disbanded early in 1969.

            <value>Belcher and McGauty undertook a

              Over several months the officers conducted a systematic campaign of harassment
              and threats against club managers and members, culminating in the laying of a
              charge of gross indecency against two men who were observed dancing together at
              the Melody Room, 457 Church Street. During the preliminary hearing. Belcher and
              McGauty produced conflicting testimony and the charges were dropped on September 24, 1964. The two detectives were not
              deterred, and they returned to the Melody Room in early 1965. At that time their disorderly conduct and verbal abuse led the
              manager to have them charged with trespassing after they refused to leave the
              club. (See also August 5,14,1964.)

            <value>Qué. Member of Parliament Louis-Joseph Pigeon
              (pc-Joliette-L'Assomption-Montcalm), forty-two, was charged with indecently
              assaulting eighteen-year-old Raymond Emond on
              the main street of Hull, Québec. Emond claimed
              that Pigeon had led him into a laneway where he had made indecent propositions,
              upon which a struggle ensued. The charge was dropped when Judge Avila Labelle ruled that the Crown had not proved
              guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

            <value>The Association for Social Knowledge (ASK), the
              first homophile organization in Canada, was officially formed. It was inspired
              by the activities of the Mattachine Society in the United States, and was
              encouraged by Bruce Somers, a Vancouver interior decorator, who became ASK'S first
              president, ASK was an independent organization established "to help society to
              understand and accept variations from the sexual norm." Its membership was
              almost equally divided between gay men and lesbians from the beginning, ASK
              supported law reform and sponsored public lectures and discussion groups, coffee
              parties (Gab 'N' Java), social events and outings, a lending library, and,
              eventually, a drop-in and community centre. The ASK Newsletter was filled with serious articles (some reprinted
              from other sources), news of local events, and Association news, ASK collapsed
              in the summer of 1965 but revived the next year; it disbanded early in 1969.
